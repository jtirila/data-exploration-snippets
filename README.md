# data-exploration-snippets

This will be a repository for a more or less random and incoherent repository 
of various kinds of experiments in data science / data mining / whatever. 

If something useful appears here and someone wants to use some of the stuff, 
feel free to do so. At least for now, everything will be in public domain.
